# Emotion_Detection

This small project uses the camera to detect faces and classify the emotion described by the facial characteristics.

OpenCV, which is a library of programming functions aimed at real-time computer vision, provided us the HAAR classifier for face detection.

We have implemented a 5 layer CNN for emotion detection
FER2013 for training and testing
62.25% accuracy on test set
